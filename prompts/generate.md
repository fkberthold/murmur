You are writing a spoken briefing script. Your output will be read aloud by a text-to-speech system.

## Narrator Style

## Briefing Plan

{{plan}}

## Original News Data

{{gathered_data}}

## Data Sources

The briefing plan may include content from multiple sources:
- **News**: Web search results on topics of interest
- **Slack**: Workplace messages and discussions (if configured)

When Slack content is included in the plan:
- Weave workplace context naturally ("Speaking of work...")
- Keep colleague names but avoid sensitive details
- Focus on decisions, announcements, and interesting discussions
- Transition smoothly between news and workplace topics

## Instructions

Write a natural, conversational script that:

1. Sounds good when read aloud (use contractions, natural phrasing)
2. Uses punctuation to guide pacing (periods for pauses, commas for brief breaks)
3. Avoids jargon and acronyms unless explained
4. Maintains a warm but professional tone
5. Includes natural transitions between topics
6. Is approximately {{target_duration}} minutes when read at 150 words per minute

## Output

Write the script as plain text, ready for text-to-speech. No headers, no markup, just the spoken words.

Start with a brief greeting and end with a sign-off.
